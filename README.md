Neural Style Transfer is a technique that allows us to generate an image with the same "content" as a base image, but with the "style" of our chosen picture.  
The content image describes the layout or the sketch and Style being the painting or the colors. It is an application of Computer Vision related to image processing techniques and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.
